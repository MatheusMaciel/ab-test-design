# A/B Test design

This project aims to design an A/B test to a hypothetical change on Udacity website that should affect user decision to enroll on a 2 week free trial.

The test involves:
* Select, characterize and validate invariant and evaluation metrics.
* Decide experiment duration and exposure.
* Results sanity check.
* Draw conclusions based on results.
* Decide whether the change should be launched or not.

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.
